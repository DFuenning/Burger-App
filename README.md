# Burger-App

## Purpose
This app was created for users to "make" a burger of their choosing and devour it! The app is updating a SQL database with the burgers names and posting them on your browser. This project was less for the user and more to teach me how to use SQL and update information in a DB based on a button click. 

## Tech Used
Burger App was created with MySQL, Handlebars, Node.js and a little bit of CSS.
